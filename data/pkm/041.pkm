    "Shield": "Zubat live in caves, down where the sun's light won't reach. In the morning, they gather together to keep each other warm as they sleep.",
    "Moon": "When exposed to sunlight, they suffer burns. The frequency of their ultrasonic waves can differ slightly from colony to colony.",
    "Black": "It checks its surroundings and location using reflections of the ultrasonic waves from its mouth.",
    "Black2": "It does not need eyes, because it emits ultrasonic waves to check its surroundings while it flies.",
    "FireRed": "It has no eyes. Instead, it relies on its ultrasonic cries for echo location to flit about in darkness.",
    "HearthGold": "While flying, it constantly emits ultrasonic waves from its mouth to check its surroundings.",
    "Sword": "It emits ultrasonic waves from its mouth to check its surroundings. Even in tight caves, Zubat flies around with skill.",
    "Sapphire": "Zubat avoids sunlight because exposure causes it to become unhealthy. During the daytime, it stays in caves or under the eaves of old houses, sleeping while hanging upside down.",
    "Platinum": "It checks its surroundings and location using reflections of the ultrasonic waves from its mouth.",
    "Emerald": "While living in pitch-black caverns, their eyes gradually grew shut and deprived them of vision. They use ultrasonic waves to detect obstacles.",
    "X": "Even though it has no eyes, it can sense obstacles using ultrasonic waves it emits from it mouth.",
    "Y": "It has no eyes. Instead, it relies on its ultrasonic cries for echolocation to flit about in darkness.",
    "Ruby": "Zubat remains quietly unmoving in a dark spot during the bright daylight hours. It does so because prolonged exposure to the sun causes its body to become slightly burned.",
    "Soulsilver": "Capable of flying safely in dark places, it emits ultrasonic cries to check for any obstacles.",
    "AlphaSapphire": "Zubat avoids sunlight because exposure causes it to become unhealthy. During the daytime, it stays in caves or under the eaves of old houses, sleeping while hanging upside down.",
    "Gold": "While flying, it constantly emits ultrasonic waves from its mouth to check its surroundings.",
    "UltraMoon": "Their skin is so thin that they'll be burned if sunlight hits them. When it gets cold out, they gather together to warm one another's bodies.",
    "Blue": "Forms colonies in perpetually dark places. Uses ultrasonic waves to identify and approach targets.",
    "LetsGoPikachu": "Emits ultrasonic cries while it flies. They act as a sonar used to check for objects in its way.",
    "White2": "It does not need eyes, because it emits ultrasonic waves to check its surroundings while it flies.",
    "Diamond": "Even though it has no eyes, it can sense obstacles using ultrasonic waves it emits from it mouth.",
    "UltraSun": "It has no eyeballs, so it can't see. It checks its surroundings via the ultrasonic waves it emits from its mouth.",
    "Sun": "It sleeps in caves during the day. It has no eyes, so to check its surroundings while flying, it emits ultrasonic waves.",
    "OmegaRuby": "Zubat remains quietly unmoving in a dark spot during the bright daylight hours. It does so because prolonged exposure to the sun causes its body to become slightly burned.",
    "Red": "Forms colonies in perpetually dark places. Uses ultrasonic waves to identify and approach targets.",
    "Pearl": "Disliking sunlight, it sleeps deep in forests and caves until sundown.",
    "Silver": "Capable of flying safely in dark places, it emits ultrasonic cries to check for any obstacles.",
    "White": "It checks its surroundings and location using reflections of the ultrasonic waves from its mouth.",
