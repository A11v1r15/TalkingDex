    "AlphaSapphire": "It's covered in a slimy membrane that makes any punches or kicks slide off it harmlessly.",
    "UltraMoon": "Its body is mostly water. If it dries out, it will die, so it's always sitting with perfect stillness in the shade.",
    "Sword": "Because most of its body is water, it will dry up if the weather becomes too arid. It's considered the weakest dragon Pokémon.",
    "Shield": "Their horns are powerful sensors. As soon as Goomy pick up any sign of enemies, they go into hiding. This is how they've survived.",
    "Moon": "Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden mucous membrane. Anyone who touches it needs some thorough hand-washing.",
    "X": "The weakest Dragon-type Pokémon, it lives in damp, shady places, so its body doesn't dry out.",
    "Y": "It's covered in a slimy membrane that makes any punches or kicks slide off it harmlessly.",
    "UltraSun": "It uses its horns to check out its surroundings. They're very sensitive, so if you grab them, it will feel a strong shock and be unable to move.",
    "Sun": "The weakest of all Dragon-type Pokémon, it's unable to breathe if its skin dries out, so it sticks to shady places.",
    "OmegaRuby": "The weakest Dragon-type Pokémon, it lives in damp, shady places, so its body doesn't dry out."
