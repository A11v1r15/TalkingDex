    "Shield": "Being bitten by a Shellder shocked this Pok√©mon into standing on two legs. If the Shellder lets go, it seems Slowbro will turn back into a Slowpoke.",

    "HearthGold": "If the tail-biting Shellder is thrown off in a harsh battle, it reverts to being an ordinary Slowpoke.",
    "Sword": "Slowpoke became Slowbro when a Shellder bit on to its tail. Sweet flavors seeping from the tail make the Shellder feel as if its life is a dream.",
    "Sapphire": "Slowbro's tail has a Shellder firmly attached with a bite. As a result, the tail can't be used for fishing anymore. This causes Slowbro to grudgingly swim and catch prey instead.",

    "UltraMoon": "Shellder, in its greed to suck out more and more sweetness from Slowbro's tail, has metamorphosed into a spiral-shaped shell.",
