    "UltraMoon": "Crabrawler has been known to mistake Exeggutor for a coconut tree and climb it. The enraged Exeggutor shakes it off and stomps it.",
    "Moon": "It punches so much, its pincers often come off from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What little meat they contain is rich and delicious.",
    "UltraSun": "Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler are like boxing matches.",
    "Sun": "While guarding its weak points with its pincers, it looks for an opening and unleashes punches. When it loses, it foams at the mouth and faints."
