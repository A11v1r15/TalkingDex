    "Shield": "As Psyduck gets stressed out, its headache gets progressively worse. It uses intense psychic energy to overwhelm those around it.",
    "Moon": "This Pokémon is troubled by constant headaches. The more pain it's in, the more powerful its psychokinesis becomes.",
    "Black": "Overwhelmed by enigmatic abilities, it suffers a constant headache. It sometimes uses mysterious powers.",
    "Black2": "When headaches stimulate its brain cells, which are usually inactive, it can use a mysterious power.",
    "FireRed": "It is constantly wracked by a headache. When the headache turns intense, it begins using mysterious powers.",
    "HearthGold": "It has mystical powers but doesn't recall that it has used them. That is why it always looks puzzled.",
    "Sword": "Psyduck is constantly beset by headaches. If the Pokémon lets its strange power erupt, apparently the pain subsides for a while.",
    "Sapphire": "If it uses its mysterious power, Psyduck can't remember having done so. It apparently can't form a memory of such an event because it goes into an altered state that is much like deep sleep.",
    "Platinum": "Overwhelmed by enigmatic abilities, it suffers a constant headache. It sometimes uses mysterious powers.",
    "Emerald": "When its headache intensifies, it starts using strange powers. However, it has no recollection of its powers, so it always looks befuddled and bewildered.",

    "Y": "It has mystical powers but doesn't recall that it has used them. That is why it always looks puzzled.",
    "Ruby": "Psyduck uses a mysterious power. When it does so, this Pokémon generates brain waves that are supposedly only seen in sleepers. This discovery spurred controversy among scholars.",
    "Soulsilver": "If its chronic headache peaks, it may exhibit odd powers. It seems unable to recall such an episode.",
    "AlphaSapphire": "If it uses its mysterious power, Psyduck can't remember having done so. It apparently can't form a memory of such an event because it goes into an altered state that is much like deep sleep.",
    "Gold": "It has mystical powers but doesn't recall that it has used them. That is why it always looks puzzled.",
    "UltraMoon": "It has been found that its brain cells are 10 times more active when Psyduck is experiencing a headache.",
    "Blue": "While lulling its enemies with its vacant look, this wily Pokémon will use psychokinetic powers.",
    "LetsGoPikachu": "Always tormented by headaches. It uses psychic powers, but whether it intends to do so is not known.",
    "White2": "When headaches stimulate its brain cells, which are usually inactive, it can use a mysterious power.",
    "Diamond": "If its usual headache worsens, it starts exhibiting odd powers. It can't remember doing so, however.",
    "UltraSun": "Using psychokinesis gives it a headache, so it normally passes the time spacing out and doing as little as possible.",
    "Sun": "As a result of headaches so fierce they cause it to cry, it sometimes uses psychokinesis without meaning to.",
    "OmegaRuby": "Psyduck uses a mysterious power. When it does so, this Pokémon generates brain waves that are supposedly only seen in sleepers. This discovery spurred controversy among scholars.",
    "Red": "While lulling its enemies with its vacant look, this wily Pokémon will use psychokinetic powers.",
    "Pearl": "It never remembers using its odd powers, so it always tilts its head in puzzlement.",

    "LetsGoEevee": "Always tormented by headaches. It uses psychic powers, but whether it intends to do so is not known.",
    "Crystal": "The only time it can use its psychic power is when its sleeping brain cells happen to wake."
