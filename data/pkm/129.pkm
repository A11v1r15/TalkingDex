    "Shield": "This weak and pathetic Pokémon gets easily pushed along rivers when there are strong currents.",
    "Moon": "Its reckless leaps make it easy pickings for predators. On the bright side, many Pokémon enjoy longer life spans, thanks to Magikarp.",
    "Black": "A Magikarp living for many years can leap a mountain using Splash. The move remains useless, though.",
    "Black2": "A Magikarp living for many years can leap a mountain using Splash. The move remains useless, though.",
    "FireRed": "It is virtually worthless in terms of both power and speed. It is the most weak and pathetic Pokémon in the world.",
    "HearthGold": "An underpowered, pathetic Pokémon. It may jump high on rare occasions, but never more than seven feet.",
    "Sword": "It is virtually worthless in terms of both power and speed. It is the most weak and pathetic Pokémon in the world.",
    "Sapphire": "Magikarp is virtually useless in battle as it can only splash around. As a result, it is considered to be weak. However, it is actually a very hardy Pokémon that can survive in any body of water no matter how polluted it is.",
    "Platinum": "A Magikarp living for many years can leap a mountain using Splash. The move remains useless, though.",
    "Emerald": "Its swimming muscles are weak, so it is easily washed away by currents. In places where water pools, you can see many Magikarp deposited there by the flow.",
    "X": "It is virtually worthless in terms of both power and speed. It is the most weak and pathetic Pokémon in the world.",
    "Y": "In the distant past, it was somewhat stronger than the horribly weak descendants that exist today.",
    "Ruby": "Magikarp is a pathetic excuse for a Pokémon that is only capable of flopping and splashing. This behavior prompted scientists to undertake research into it.",
    "Soulsilver": "For no reason, it jumps and splashes about, making it easy for predators like Pidgeotto to catch it mid-jump.",
    "AlphaSapphire": "Magikarp is virtually useless in battle as it can only splash around. As a result, it is considered to be weak. However, it is actually a very hardy Pokémon that can survive in any body of water no matter how polluted it is.",
    "Gold": "An underpowered, pathetic Pokémon. It may jump high on rare occasions, but never more than seven feet.",
    "UltraMoon": "Thanks to their strong hold on life, dirty water doesn't bother them at all. They live in waters all over the world!",
    "Blue": "In the distant past, it was somewhat stronger than the horribly weak descendants that exist today.",
    "LetsGoPikachu": "Famous for being very unreliable. It can be found swimming in seas, lakes, rivers and shallow puddles.",
    "White2": "A Magikarp living for many years can leap a mountain using Splash. The move remains useless, though.",
    "Diamond": "It is said to be the world's weakest Pokémon. No one knows why it has managed to survive.",
    "UltraSun": "In the distant past, they were fairly strong, but they have become gradually weaker over time.",
    "Sun": "Although weak and helpless, this Pokémon is incredibly fertile. They exist in such multitudes, you'll soon grow tired of seeing them.",
    "OmegaRuby": "Magikarp is a pathetic excuse for a Pokémon that is only capable of flopping and splashing. This behavior prompted scientists to undertake research into it.",
    "Red": "In the distant past, it was somewhat stronger than the horribly weak descendants that exist today.",
    "Pearl": "It is unable to swim against even slow-moving currents. It always splashes about for some reason.",
    "Silver": "For no reason, it jumps and splashes about, making it easy for predators like Pidgeotto to catch it mid-jump.",
    "White": "A Magikarp living for many years can leap a mountain using Splash. The move remains useless, though.",
    "Yellow": "Famous for being very unreliable. It can be found swimming in seas, lakes, rivers and shallow puddles.",
