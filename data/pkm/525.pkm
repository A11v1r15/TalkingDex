    "AlphaSapphire": "When it is healthy, its core sticks out. Always facing the same way, it swiftly moves front to back and left to right.",
    "UltraMoon": "Its orange crystals are lumps of powerful energy. They're valuable, so Boldore is sometimes targeted for them.",
    "Shield": "It relies on sound in order to monitor what's in its vicinity. When angered, it will attack without ever changing the direction it's facing.",
    "Moon": "It explores caves in search of underground water. It's not comfortable around water, so this Pokémon takes great care in lapping it up.",
    "White2": "When it is healthy, its core sticks out. Always facing the same way, it swiftly moves front to back and left to right.",
    "UltraSun": "The energy overflowing from its body has turned into orange crystals that are hard enough to smash diamonds.",
    "Black": "When it overflows with power, the orange crystal on its body glows. It looks for underground water in caves.",
    "Black2": "When it is healthy, its core sticks out. Always facing the same way, it swiftly moves front to back and left to right.",
    "Sun": "Its orange crystal is a mass of energy. Just one crystal fragment would provide enough fuel for a hundred dump trucks.",
    "OmegaRuby": "Because its energy was too great to be contained, the energy leaked and formed orange crystals.",
    "White": "Because its energy was too great to be contained, the energy leaked and formed orange crystals.",
    "Sword": "If you see its orange crystals start to glow, be wary. It's about to fire off bursts of energy.",
    "X": "Because its energy was too great to be contained, the energy leaked and formed orange crystals.",
    "Y": "When it is healthy, its core sticks out. Always facing the same way, it swiftly moves front to back and left to right."
