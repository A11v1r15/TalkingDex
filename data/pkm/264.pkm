    "AlphaSapphire": "When hunting, Linoone will make a beeline straight for the prey at a full run. While this Pokémon is capable of topping 60 mph, it has to come to a screeching halt before it can turn.",
    "Shield": "It uses its explosive speed and razor-sharp claws to bring down prey. Running along winding paths is not its strong suit.",
    "White2": "It charges prey at speeds over 60 mph. However, because it can only run straight, it often fails.",
    "Diamond": "It charges prey at speeds over 60 mph. However, because it can only run straight, it often fails.",

    "Pearl": "It charges prey at speeds over 60 mph. However, because it can only run straight, it often fails.",
    "White": "It charges prey at speeds over 60 mph. However, because it can only run straight, it often fails.",

    "LeafGreen": "When running in a straight line, it can top 60 miles per hour. However, it has a tough time with curved roads.",
    "Platinum": "It charges prey at speeds over 60 mph. However, because it can only run straight, it often fails.",
    "Emerald": "It is exceedingly fast if it only has to run in a straight line. When it spots pond-dwelling prey underwater, it quickly leaps in and catches it with its sharp claws.",
    "X": "When running in a straight line, it can easily top 60 miles an hour. It has a tough time with curved roads.",
