    "UltraMoon": "Before it stops to think, it just starts pummeling. There are records of its turning back avalanches with a flurry of punches.",
    "Moon": "It just throws punches indiscriminately. In times of desperation, it can lop off its own pincers and fire them like rockets.",
    "UltraSun": "It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its foes. It can even smash thick walls of ice to bits!",
    "Sun": "It aimed for the top but got lost and ended up on a snowy mountain. Being forced to endure the cold, this Pokémon evolved and grew fur."
