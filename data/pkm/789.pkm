    "UltraMoon": "Whether or not it's a Pokémon from this world is a mystery. When it's in a jam, it warps away to a safe place to hide.",
    "Sword": "This Pokémon came from another universe. Its gaseous body is so light that even a gentle breeze can blow it away.",
    "Shield": "Cosmog is very curious but not very cautious, often placing itself in danger. If things start to look dicey, it teleports away.",
    "Moon": "In ages past, it was called the child of the stars. It's said to be a Pokémon from another world, but no specific details are known.",
    "UltraSun": "Even though its helpless, gaseous body can be blown away by the slightest breeze, it doesn't seem to care.",
    "Sun": "Its body is gaseous and frail. It slowly grows as it collects dust from the atmosphere."
