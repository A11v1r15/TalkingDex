    "Shield": "Bug Pokémon are Lickitung's main food source. This Pokémon paralyzes its prey with a lick from its long tongue, then swallows the prey whole.",
    "Black": "When it extends its over-six-foot-long tongue, its tail quivers. There is a possibility they are connected.",
    "Black2": "Being licked by its long, saliva-covered tongue leaves a tingling sensation. Extending its tongue retracts its tail.",
    "FireRed": "Its tongue is twice the length of its body. It can be moved like an arm for grabbing food and attacking.",
    "HearthGold": "Its tongue has well-developed nerves that run to the very tip, so it can be deftly manipulated.",
    "Sword": "If this Pokémon's sticky saliva gets on you and you don't clean it off, an intense itch will set in. The itch won't go away, either.",
    "Sapphire": "Whenever Lickitung comes across something new, it will unfailingly give it a lick. It does so because it memorizes things by texture and by taste. It is somewhat put off by sour things.",
    "Platinum": "When it extends its over-six-foot-long tongue, its tail quivers. There is a possibility they are connected.",
    "Emerald": "Whenever it sees something unfamiliar, it always licks the object because it memorizes things by texture and taste. It is somewhat put off by sour things.",
    "X": "Its long tongue, slathered in a gooey saliva, sticks to anything, so it is very useful.",
    "Y": "Its tongue is twice the length of its body. It can be moved like an arm for grabbing food and attacking.",
    "Ruby": "Whenever Lickitung comes across something new, it will unfailingly give it a lick. It does so because it memorizes things by texture and by taste. It is somewhat put off by sour things.",
    "Soulsilver": "Its long tongue, slathered with a gooey saliva, sticks to anything, so it is very useful.",
    "AlphaSapphire": "Whenever Lickitung comes across something new, it will unfailingly give it a lick. It does so because it memorizes things by texture and by taste. It is somewhat put off by sour things.",
    "Gold": "Its tongue has well-developed nerves that run to the very tip, so it can be deftly manipulated.",
    "UltraMoon": "It licks filth clean with its tongue. Whatever it licks always stinks afterward, so whether it's really clean is...questionable.",
    "Blue": "Its tongue can be extended like a chameleon's. It leaves a tingling sensation when it licks enemies.",
    "LetsGoPikachu": "Its tongue spans almost seven feet and moves more freely than its forelegs. Its licks can cause paralysis.",
    "White2": "Being licked by its long, saliva-covered tongue leaves a tingling sensation. Extending its tongue retracts its tail.",
    "Diamond": "Instead of hands, it uses its tongue, which is twice its height. Its sticky saliva grips anything.",
    "UltraSun": "It checks out whatever's around it by licking everything. If you don't clean off a spot where it's licked you, you'll break out in a rash!",
    "OmegaRuby": "Whenever Lickitung comes across something new, it will unfailingly give it a lick. It does so because it memorizes things by texture and by taste. It is somewhat put off by sour things.",
    "Red": "Its tongue can be extended like a chameleon's. It leaves a tingling sensation when it licks enemies.",
    "Pearl": "Instead of hands, it uses its tongue, which is twice its height. Its sticky saliva grips anything.",
    "Silver": "Its long tongue, slathered with a thick gooey saliva, sticks to anything, so it is very useful.",
    "White": "When it extends its over-six-foot-long tongue, its tail quivers. There is a possibility they are connected.",
    "Yellow": "Its tongue spans almost 7 feet and moves more freely than its forelegs. Its licks can cause paralysis.",
    "LeafGreen": "Its tongue can be extended like a chameleon's. It leaves a tingling sensation when it licks enemies.",
    "LetsGoEevee": "Its tongue spans almost seven feet and moves more freely than its forelegs. Its licks can cause paralysis.",
    "Crystal": "It has a tongue that is over 6'6\" long. It uses this long tongue to lick its body clean."
