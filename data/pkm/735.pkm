    "Moon": "It adores having Rattata and Raticate for dinner, but as it's diurnal, it never encounters them. This Pokémon boasts incredible patience.",
    "UltraSun": "Although it wasn't originally found in Alola, this Pokémon was brought over a long time ago when there was a huge Rattata outbreak.",
    "Sun": "When it finds a trace of its prey, it patiently stakes out the location...but it's always snoozing by nightfall."
